# Ruby Enumerables & Pry

## Prerequisites

- DataTypes: strings, arrays, integer, booleans, hashes, floats, undefined, nil, char
    - variables hold the info but are not inherently their own data type 
- Conditionals 
    - if/elsif/else/end
    - if statements
    - the condition innnn the while 
    - case (switch)
    - until's condition
    - operators: and / or ==== && and ||, <, >, ==, !
    - ternary (fiiiireeee) ==> next level 
- Loops 
    - while
    - for loop
    - do (code block)
    - times
- Arrays vs Hashes
- Accessing Arrays & Accessing Hashes
- Iterating through Arrays and Hashes using `.each`

## Agenda

- Mindset: don't just memorize (not the syntax, not nothing), understand the tool and when to use it
    - focus on when to use what tool 
    - get comfy reading the docs
- Enumerables:
    - .each
    - .map && .collect  ==> a new array of the same length, with whatever the block returned for each element 
        ==> all my spices in the bottles ===> a tsp of each spice
    - .filter && .select  ===> a new array with the original elements for whom block returns true 
        ===> all my spices ==> just the green ones 
    - .find
        ===> all my spices ==> find cumin for me 
- Pry
- Show where this code lives on github and how to access it! 
    


## Icebox
- Extra enumberables:
    - .any, .all, .include?, .count/.length, .each_with_index, .sort, .reduce, .flatten, .detect
- alias'es in your zshrc / bashprofile
