# Agenda
- What are APIs?
- High level HTTP and HTTP Verbs; How those relate to CRUD

  - Request during CLI behavior to get category's questions 


## CRUD and APIs and HTTP verbs
C - create ===> POST (to create a new entity on the server)
R - read ===> GET (anytime you visit a website, youre sending a GET request)
U - update ===> PUT (replaces all) and *PATCH* (replaces part)
D - destroy ===> DELETE... deletes the specified resource
